# KittyMath

Kitty Tiger Strikes Again.  You probably shouldn't have let Kitty 
help you balance your bank books.  It seems that Kitty wrote all
your numbers down half the time, and the other half of the time 
Kitty wrote the numbers as words.

Write a string extension method that will convert Kitty's scribblings 
into decimal numbers.
